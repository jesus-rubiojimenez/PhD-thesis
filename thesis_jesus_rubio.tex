% Quality Assurance Agency descriptors for the award of qualifications at
% the doctoral level
%
% Doctorates are awarded to students who have demonstrated:
%
% - the creation and interpretation of new knowledge, through original 
% research or other advanced scholarship, of a quality to satisfy peer 
% review, extend the forefront of the discipline, and merit publication;
%
% - a systematic acquisition and understanding of a substantial body of 
% knowledge which is at the forefront of an academic discipline or area 
% of professional practice;
%
% - the general ability to conceptualise, design and implement a project 
% for the generation of new knowledge, applications or understanding at 
% the forefront of the discipline, and to adjust the project design in

% General presentation checks:
%
%   - All chapters/sections are present and complete, correctly numbered 
%   and in the correct order.
%
%   - Tables of contents, etc. are present and correct.
%
%   - All Figures and Tables are present, inserted in the correct place,

\chapter*{\vspace{-1cm}Declaration}
I hereby declare that, unless otherwise indicated, the results presented in this thesis are the product of my own independent research, and that, to the best of my knowledge, all the relevant sources have been appropriately acknowledged. In addition, this thesis has not been and will not be submitted in whole or in part to another University for the award of any other degree.

Some of these results have already been published or are available in a preprint:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Non-asymptotic analysis of quantum metrology protocols beyond the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound}, \underline{Jes\'{u}s Rubio}, Paul Knott and Jacob Dunningham, J. Phys. Commun. 2 015027 (2018).
\item \emph{Quantum metrology in the presence of limited data}, \underline{Jes\'{u}s Rubio} and Jacob Dunningham, New J. Phys. 21 043037 (2019).
\item \emph{Designing quantum experiments with a genetic algorithm}, Rosanna Nichols, Lana Mineh, \underline{Jes\'{u}s Rubio}, Jonathan C. F. Matthews and Paul A. Knott, Quantum Sci. Technol. 4 045012 (2019).
\item \emph{Bayesian multi-parameter quantum metrology with limited data}, \underline{Jes\'{u}s Rubio} and Jacob Dunningham, arXiv:1906.04123 (2019).
\end{enumerate}
I confirm that I am responsible for the calculations and contents in works $1$, $2$ and $4$, where the co-authors provided invaluable support and guidance by discussing the results, verifying the methods and proposing changes to enhance the quality of the manuscripts. Regarding work $3$, my contribution was twofold. On the one hand, I prepared a Matlab module with a Bayesian fitness function to be included within the AdaQuantum algorithm. On the other hand, I performed the Bayesian analysis of some of the experimental designs produced by this algorithm. 

Finally, some of the asymptotic results for sensor-symmetric networks in chapter \ref{chap:networks} were partially obtained in collaboration with Paul Knott, Timothy Proctor and Jacob Dunningham, while I was fully responsible for the Bayesian calculations.

% Summary:
\justify{Science relies on our practical ability to extract information from reality, since processing this information is essential for developing theories that explain our world. This thesis is precisely the study of how to extract and process information using quantum systems when a constrained amount of resources means that the available data is limited. The natural framework for this task is quantum metrology, a set of tools to model and design quantum measurement strategies. Equipped with this theory, we advocate a Bayesian approach as the appropriate formalism to study systems with a finite amount of resources, which is a non-asymptotic problem, and we propose a methodology for non-asymptotic quantum metrology. To start with, we show the consistency of taking those solutions that are optimal in the asymptotic regime of many trials as a guide to calculate a generalised measure of uncertainty in the Bayesian framework. This provides an approximate but useful way of studying the non-asymptotic regime whenever a direct Bayesian optimisation is intractable, and it avoids non-physical results that can arise when only the asymptotic theory is employed. Secondly, we construct a new non-asymptotic Bayesian bound without relying on the previous approximation by first selecting the optimal quantum strategy for a single shot, and then simulating a sequence of repetitions of this scheme, which is suitable for experiments where we do not wish or cannot correlate different trials. These methods are applied to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which is a single-parameter problem, and to quantum sensing networks where the nodes are either qubits or optical modes, which are multi-parameter protocols. Our results provide a detailed characterisation of how the interplay between prior information, entanglement and a limited amount of data affects the performance of quantum metrology protocols, which has important implications for the analysis of theory and experiments in this field.}

Those of us who find meaning in creating and understanding often tend to enjoy the pleasure of a good challenge, and a doctoral thesis has proven to be one of the best. I feel very grateful for this fantastic opportunity, which would not have been possible without my supervisor Jacob Dunningham. He not only gave me the chance to live in another country and join his group at Sussex, but he has also provided excellent guidance, full of insights and ideas. From our many discussions I have learned a very natural and intuitive way of doing physics, and it has been a pleasure to work in such friendly company. 

It has also been fantastic working and discussing physics with the rest of the group - Paul, Simon, Anthony, James, Michail and Sam. Paul's guidance, always full of optimism, was invaluable during his time as my second supervisor, and I have benefited enormously from our collaborations (my current appreciation of numerical techniques would have not happened without his help!).

I am indebted to collaborators and friends - Alfredo, Tim, George, Dominic, Matthew, Jasminder, Christos, Francesco and many others - who through many interesting discussions have helped me to refine my ideas, and to develop them further. I would also like to thank Dimitrios for his help with the mathematical literature of probability theory, and Petr for introducing me to Jaynes's work; my thesis would have been very different without it. These interactions have been possible thanks to attending many interesting conferences, which I was able to do thanks to the generous financial support provided by the University of Sussex and the South East Physics Network (SEPnet) to complete my PhD.

Working towards my PhD at Sussex has been a great experience. Its friendly staff are always ready to be helpful, and its library is superb. In fact, the library has been an invaluable source of material during development of many sections of this thesis. It has been a great pleasure meeting many fascinating people, and to have had the opportunity of developing many activities. There was always time to chat with Luc\'{i}a and let the idealists inside us to run free, to have entertaining discussions and share experiences with Harry, Nick and Jean-Marc, or to run teaching workshops with Reece. And I enormously enjoyed every session of our AMO Theory Club - Kathryn, Pedro, Germ\'{a}n, Samuel, Graham, Charlie and Michail - which was always an excellent opportunity to learn something new beyond our thesis topics. 

In addition, I am very grateful for all the support and encouragement that I have received from Kathryn during this journey. She has been a continuous source of inspiration to explore new ways of thinking about the world, and to better appreciate the wonders of life. In addition, I would like to thank her for having read some of the preliminary drafts and having provided invaluable feedback.  

Last but not least, I would like to thank all the people who have also supported my project both from home and from many other parts of the world: Isabel and Alfredo, for our fantastic meetings when I visit Madrid; In\'{e}s and Eli, for a friendship that never ends; H\'{e}ctor, because indeed great minds think alike; Anah\'{i}, for always being so trustworthy; Ana, for always being open to the world; Pablo, for our conversations about life; and my family, for your support no matter where we are.  

Thanks to all of you.
